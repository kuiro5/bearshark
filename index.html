        <h5>Ursidae Carcharhinus Arcarcharias</h5>
          <p>The mighty and terrifying bearshark is of the family Ursidae, like all other bears, but is of the genus Carcharhinus, like all other sharks.</p>
          <p>The primary species, due to it's apex predator stature, is the grizzly white, or Arcarcharias.</p>
          <p>One subspecies is the polar bearshark.</p>

      <h1>Anatomy and Biology</h1>
      <p>The typical Bearshark possesses the midsection of a bear along with all four clawed appendages, while the head and tail resemble those of a shark. Included on the back is a dorsal fin. These features make the Bearshark's body perfect for swimming in either fresh or salt water, while also able to wander about on almost any terrain. Their claws are excellent for climbing trees and mauling children and puppies.</p>
      <p>Originally it was thought arctic habitats were the only uninhabitable regions for Bearsharks, but recently a Bearshark was found in Northern Russia. A shark had joined with a polar bear creating a sub-species, the Polar Bearshark.</p>
      <p>Another sub-species is the Pyro Bearshark, also known as the Fire Bearshark. This species possesses a physical trait not found in either bears or sharks. The Pyro Bearshark’s body is engulfed in self-created flames. Though there has been no proof, there have been individual claims that it is also capable of breathing fire. It is not entirely known how this trait evolved, but some specialists believe that it comes from a recessive gene found in some bears and sharks.</p>
