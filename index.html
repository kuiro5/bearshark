        <h3>/ber SHärk/ noun</h3>
        <h3>Just when you thought it was safe to get drunk on the beach and/or wooded areas…</h3>
        <h5>Ursidae Carcharhinus Arcarcharias</h5>
        <p>The mighty and terrifying bearshark is of the family Ursidae, like all other bears, but is of the genus Carcharhinus, like all other sharks.</p>
        <p>The primary species, due to it's apex predator stature, is the grizzly white, or Arcarcharias.</p>
        <p>One subspecies is the polar bearshark.</p>

        <h1>Anatomy and Biology</h1>
        <p>The typical Bearshark possesses the midsection of a bear along with all four clawed appendages, while the head and tail resemble those of a shark. Included on the back is a dorsal fin. These features make the Bearshark's body perfect for swimming in either fresh or salt water, while also able to wander about on almost any terrain. Their claws are excellent for climbing trees and mauling children and puppies.</p>
        <p>Originally it was thought arctic habitats were the only uninhabitable regions for Bearsharks, but recently a Bearshark was found in Northern Russia. A shark had joined with a polar bear creating a sub-species, the Polar Bearshark.</p>
        <h3>Specifics</h3>
        <p><strong>Height:</strong>8 to 11 feet tall</p>
        <p><strong>Weight:</strong>3 to 5 tons</p>
        <p><strong>Overall:</strong>Bigger than a shark and bear combined!</p>
        <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong>Between 1 and 3 thousand years</p>
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>Bearsharks can breathe underwater via gills or above water using their mammal lungs.</p>
        <p>Another sub-species is the Pyro Bearshark, also known as the Fire Bearshark. This species possesses a physical trait not found in either bears or sharks. The Pyro Bearshark’s body is engulfed in self-created flames. Though there has been no proof, there have been individual claims that it is also capable of breathing fire. It is not entirely known how this trait evolved, but some specialists believe that it comes from a recessive gene found in some bears and sharks.</p>

      <div class="col hero-text">
        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <p>The behavioral patterns of a Bearshark greatly differ from that of its natural parents.</p>
        <p>Bears are seen by liberals as scavengers only, while Sharks prey primarily on seals and attack humans only when they are mistaken for other creatures. These behaviors have been disproved again and again, but if so, the Bearshark loses these behaviors and gains an even deadlier instinct.</p>
        <p>They have an extremely aggressive behavior that matches their appetite. The Bearshark must constantly eat in order to maintain energy to power its massive body. It needs this energy because like the shark, Bearsharks do not sleep.</p>
        <p>They are definite predators, not scavengers, preying on larger animals. They feed primarily on humans. Though humans are not entirely large, there is a mass abundance of them that drives Bearsharks to heavily populated areas like suburbs and cities. Video, though, has caught Bearsharks preying on elephants and rhinos, and mythical stories tell that ithey also prey on creatures such as giant squids and Sasquatch.</p>
        <p>When being hunted, in water they tend to completely submerge themselves and hide, and on land they employ the same tactic by climbing up trees and waiting to jump down.</p>

    <section id="habitat" class='row justify-content-center'>
      <div class="col hero-text">
        <h1>Habitat</h1>
        <p>The bearshark is usually found near tropical islands and deep lush forests. The beast can survive in almost any environment but thrives in places where the scent of fear fills the air.</p>
        <p>Many people ask, “Where does a bearshark make it’s home, so I can be sure to avoid it?” The better question is. “Where doesn’t it make its home?”. The bearshark can be found digging underground, climbing in trees, and swimming near your resort in the beautiful Turks and Caicos Islands. They thrive in these surroundings.</p>

    <section id='mating-and-reproduction' class='row justify-content-center'>
      <div class="col hero-text">
        <h1>Mating and Reproduction</h1>
        <p>Originally it was thought that BearSharks reproduce sexually, however recent scientific evidence has shown that they reproduce by budding. Meaning that all BearSharks originate from "Bearshark Prime"; A 400 foot tall BearShark capable of unspeakable evils. But where did BearShark Prime come from? The answer of course is science(it always is). A mad scientist created it in an attempt to take over the world, but he lost control of it.</p>
        <p>For this mammoth of a creature there is no gestational period as the Bearshark Prime is able to have as many offspring as possible as quickly as it desires. These fury filled offspring will live as long as needed to complete their ultimate mission, to ruin your forest and/or beach picnic. The new offspring do not spend much time with the parents, quickly taking over it's own territory.</p>

        <h3>Animal Communications</h3>
        <p>One of the most curious creatures on our planet, Bearsharks love to chat and ask questions. They communicate these inquiries with other Bearsharks by flapping their fins and growling with their bear jaws.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Bearsharks can communicate with other creatures as well. Although, we don’t recommend it - as this method of communication is strictly biting.</p>
        <h3>Pop Culture References</h3>
        <p>Bearsharks aren’t just alive in nature - they’re alive in pop culture, too!</p>
