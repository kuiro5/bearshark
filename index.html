        <h5>Ursidae Carcharhinus Arcarcharias</h5>
          <p>The mighty and terrifying bearshark is of the family Ursidae, like all other bears, but is of the genus Carcharhinus, like all other sharks.</p>
          <p>The primary species, due to it's apex predator stature, is the grizzly white, or Arcarcharias.</p>
          <p>One subspecies is the polar bearshark.</p>

        <h1>Anatomy and Biology</h1>
        <p>The typical Bearshark possesses the midsection of a bear along with all four clawed appendages, while the head and tail resemble those of a shark. Included on the back is a dorsal fin. These features make the Bearshark's body perfect for swimming in either fresh or salt water, while also able to wander about on almost any terrain. Their claws are excellent for climbing trees and mauling children and puppies.</p>
        <p>Originally it was thought arctic habitats were the only uninhabitable regions for Bearsharks, but recently a Bearshark was found in Northern Russia. A shark had joined with a polar bear creating a sub-species, the Polar Bearshark.</p>
        <h3>Specifics</h3>
        <p><strong>Height:</strong>8 to 11 feet tall</p>
        <p><strong>Weight:</strong>3 to 5 tons</p>
        <p><strong>Overall:</strong>Bigger than a shark and bear combined!</p>
        <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong>Between 1 and 3 thousand years</p>
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>Bearsharks can breathe underwater via gills or above water using their mammal lungs.</p>
        <p>Another sub-species is the Pyro Bearshark, also known as the Fire Bearshark. This species possesses a physical trait not found in either bears or sharks. The Pyro Bearshark’s body is engulfed in self-created flames. Though there has been no proof, there have been individual claims that it is also capable of breathing fire. It is not entirely known how this trait evolved, but some specialists believe that it comes from a recessive gene found in some bears and sharks.</p>

        <h1>Behavior</h1>
        <p>The behavioral patterns of a Bearshark greatly differ from that of its natural parents.</p>
    <p>Bears are seen by liberals as scavengers only, while Sharks prey primarily on seals and attack humans only when they are mistaken for other creatures. These behaviors have been disproved again and again, but if so, the Bearshark loses these behaviors and gains an even deadlier instinct.</p>
    <p>They have an extremely aggressive behavior that matches their appetite. The Bearshark must constantly eat in order to maintain energy to power its massive body. It needs this energy because like the shark, Bearsharks do not sleep.</p>
    <p>They are definite predators, not scavengers, preying on larger animals. They feed primarily on humans. Though humans are not entirely large, there is a mass abundance of them that drives Bearsharks to heavily populated areas like suburbs and cities. Video, though, has caught Bearsharks preying on elephants and rhinos, and mythical stories tell that ithey also prey on creatures such as giant squids and Sasquatch.</p>
    <p>When being hunted, in water they tend to completely submerge themselves and hide, and on land they employ the same tactic by climbing up trees and waiting to jump down.</p>
